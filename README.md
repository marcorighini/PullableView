# PullableView
Enhanced Pull-To-Action layout

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/marcorighini/PullableView.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#marcorighini/PullableView)

## Dependency
Add this in your root `build.gradle` file (**not** your module `build.gradle` file):

```gradle
allprojects {
	repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

Then, add the library to your module `build.gradle`
```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.marcorighini:PullableView:latest.release.here'
}
```

## Features
- Pull gesture in UP, DOWN or BOTH directions
- Scroll thresholding. **Bound views** are snapped to **anchor** position if scroll over threshold else are **reset** to default position
- Bind views for **animating** (alpha and translation for now) them in respect to scroll

## Usage
There is a [sample](https://github.com/marcorighini/PullableView/tree/master/app) provided which shows how to use the library. For completeness, here is all that is required to get PullableView working:

```xml
<com.marcorighini.lib.PullableView
    android:id="@+id/pullable_view"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content">
    ....
</com.marcorighini.lib.PullableView>
```

## Attributes
Attributes that may be added to PullableView xml tag or changed programmatically through PullableView properties:
- **anchorOffsetUp** : integer corresponding to the anchor point for UP direction pull action. It's represented through the offset compared to the pullable_view top. It must be <= 0. Default: -pullable_view_top 
- **anchorOffsetDown** : integer corresponding to the anchor point for DOWN direction pull action. It's represented through the offset compared to the pullable_view bottom. It must be >= 0. Default: screen_height - pullable_view_bottom
- **scrollThresholdUp** : integer corresponding to the threshold of the UP direction pull action. It must be <= 0. If scroll amount (negative) is below (greater in absolute value) this value bound views will animate to snap value (translation or alpha) else bound views will reset to default values. Default: anchorOffsetUp/2
- **scrollThresholdDown** : integer corresponding to the threshold of the DOWN direction pull action. It must be >= 0. If scroll amount is above this value bound views will animate to snap value (translation or alpha) else bound views will reset to default values. Default: anchorOffsetBottom/2
- **direction** : enum string value (UP,DOWN,BOTH) enabling pull directions. Default: BOTH

## Bound Views and animations
PullableView has the property 

```kotlin
var boundViews = listOf<BoundView>()
```

This represents the views that are animated accordingly to the scroll amount. For example you can change the **alpha** or **translation** of these bound views. Note that tipically you have to add pullable_view to this list to have pull-to-refresh like gesture over it. 

Check the sample for usage.

## Listener 
Pullable View has the property

```kotlin
interface PullListener {
	fun onReset()
        fun onPullStart()
        fun onAnchor()
}
var listener: PullListener? = null
```

Ideally when bound views are snapped to anchor you want to perform some tasks. When tasks are finished you have to call

```kotlin
fun resetAnimated()
fun resetImmediate()
```

over pullable_view for resetting bound views to default positions
